    <h1> Timers Exercis
    </h1>

    <h2> countdown
    </h2>
    <p>
        Write a function called countdown that accepts a number as a parameter and every 1000 milliseconds decrements
        the
        value and console.logs it. Once the value is 0 it should log “DONE!” and stop.

    </p>

    <p>
        countDown(4);
        // 3
        // 2
        // 1
        // "DONE!"
    </p>

    <h2>
        randomGame
    </h2>
    <p>
        Write a function called randomGame that selects a random number between 0 and 1 every 1000 milliseconds and each
        time that a random number is picked, add 1 to a counter. If the number is greater than .75, stop the timer and
        console.log the number of tries it took before we found a number greater than .75.
